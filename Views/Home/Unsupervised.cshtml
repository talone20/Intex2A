                <p>This is a scatterplot of the area to depth correlation, as you can see there are no changes through out time in the location these mummies were buried. Most of these mummies were buried in the NE plot</p>

                    <p>This is a scatterplot of the correlation between material and depth. As you can see, linen was used consistently in for every depth. However, there was a period of time between depth 0.7 to 1.2 where wool was not used </p>
